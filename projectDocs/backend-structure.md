Introduction
The backend ensures quick and secure user authentication, data storage, management of listings, and robust communication features. Providing a reliable backbone to the application, the backend plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of this website, paving the way for smooth transactions and interactions between users.

Backend Architecture
The backend architecture of the NoCode Marketplace employs a modern and scalable design framework heavily reliant on Supabase. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, acting as the core backend component that manages databases, authentication, and storage processes. This architecture is engineered to cater to a high volume of concurrent users while maintaining robust performance levels. It utilizes SQL databases for structured data handling and supports real-time updates, making it both maintainable and extensible as the application's demands grow.

Database Management
The NoCode Marketplace utilizes a SQL-based database provided by Supabase. This choice allows structured data storage, ensuring that user profiles, startup listings, and transaction-related information remain well-organized and easily retrievable. The data is structured into tables corresponding to users, listings, and chat interactions, facilitating efficient access and manipulation. Supabase's realtime syncing capabilities ensure that database operations are immediately reflected across the platform, providing accurate and up-to-date information.

API Design and Endpoints
The application follows a RESTful API design, which is intuitive and widely supported across different platforms and tools. The API endpoints facilitate various operations, such as managing user authentication through Clerk, handling startup listings submissions, and enabling real-time chat functionalities. These endpoints ensure effective communication between the frontend and backend, allowing actions such as fetching listings with specific filters or updating user profiles.

Assignment Guidelines
A small Express (or similar) server that:
Proxies requests to the LLM API (to avoid exposing API keys in the frontend).
Manages or logs conversation data in memory or a small database (like a JSON file, sqlite, or an in-memory store).
Optionally, handles user metrics and analytics for each conversation.
Frontend calls your Node.js backend endpoints for LLM queries, public API queries, metrics, etc.
