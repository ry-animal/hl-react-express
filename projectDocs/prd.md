Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Business Chatbot

1. App Overview:

This project aims to build a responsive and interactive chatbot application designed to answer user questions about a specific small-to-medium business. The application will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language understanding and response generation, complemented by data from a public API to enhance the chatbot's capabilities. The application will be built using a React frontend with Material UI for a user-friendly interface, and optionally, a Node.js backend for improved security and data management. The primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency in integrating LLMs and external APIs, structuring code, handling data flow, and creating a functional, user-friendly chatbot experience.

2. User Flow:

User Opens Application: User accesses the chatbot application through a web browser.
Chat Interface Loads: The user is presented with a clean chat interface, including a message input box and a scrollable conversation history.
User Enters Question: The user types a question related to "The Daily Grind" (e.g., "What are your hours?") into the input box and submits it.
Frontend Sends Request:
If frontend-only: The frontend sends the user's question directly to the LLM API and, if necessary, the public API.
If backend: The frontend sends the user's question to the Node.js backend.
Backend Processes Request (if applicable):
The backend receives the user's question.
The backend may query the public API based on the user's question.
The backend sends the user's question, along with relevant business context and public API data, to the LLM API.
LLM Generates Response: The LLM processes the input, generates a response based on the provided context, and sends it back to the frontend (or backend).
Backend Sends Response (if applicable): The backend receives the LLM's response and sends it back to the frontend.
Frontend Displays Response: The frontend receives the response and displays it in the conversation history, clearly distinguishing it from the user's message.
User Continues Conversation: The user can ask follow-up questions, and the process repeats.
(Optional) Metrics Display: The user can view basic metrics like message count, response time, etc. 3. Tech Stack & APIs:
